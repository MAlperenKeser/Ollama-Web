# Ollama-Web

this project was actually an Artificial Intelligence Assisted Code Generator Application and it was going to run on minikube but it gives 404 error. Docker runs application on two container one for ollama one for application but this 2 container cant communicate properly if you fix this you can complete the project also if you download the model ollama 3.1:8b model locally and run the code locally the application works but it does not work on minikube or a container.
